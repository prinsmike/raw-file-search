# raw-file-search
A utility to recover text data from a large file.

This utility was written to recover text (mostly source code) from a damaged hard drive. It can also be used to recover text from deleted files. It searches through a large file--such as an image of a drive--one million bytes at a time. It will save a million byte chunk to an output file whenever it finds a match.
